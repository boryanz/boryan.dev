I was a professional calisthenics athlete from 2015 until 2020, competing in national and international competitions across Europe. I love keeping my work-life balance, and I'm still a fitness enthusiast years later. In order to "fight" the dad-bod type of body, I developed a system to achieve the goal of staying lean. My son was born 3 and a half weeks ago, and despite a challenges with a newborn, here is my system to keep myself lean.Â 

Current status: around 17-19% body fat
Goal: under 12% body fat
Time: 6 months

Start: 01.11.2024
Deadline: 01.05.2025

Rules:

1. Minimum daily workout time is 20 minutes, maximum 90 minutes.
2. Day off on demand.
3. No 2 consecutive days off except being injured or sick.
4. Cardio workout 2x a week.
5. No specific food restrictions, but keeping carbohydrates under 170gr per day (this will limit most of the junk food).
6. Only calisthenics + weighted calisthenics (Gym is not my natural habitat)
7. Measuring weight every week at the same time.
8. Body composition professional analysis every month and a half.

I've made a lot of similar systems throughout my life, and they are really good way to keep yourself on track. It's good to have them visible all the time or revisit them at least 2x a day.

If you have any questions, feel free to connect. 

Cheers.
