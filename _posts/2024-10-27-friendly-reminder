In 2024, the StackOverflow survey presented that 80% of developers are unhappy and hate their job. Furthermore, they showed technical debt as the number one reason why developers are frustrated and stuck in the codebase. The second thing was the complexity of the tech stacks, and in third place is time tracking. 

Your development days might be full of the same repetitive tasks, and it's easy to get stuck into routine. Fetching some API and designing the same components seems boring, but there are things you might consider. 
This blog post is just a reminder for you to be grateful for what you have right now. In this digital era, we can work from home and avoid traffic jams every day; on the other side, we can be in the office with like-minded people. If your company provides additional benefits, don't take them for granted. Salaries in tech are above average, so you cannot starve to death. You are learning new things every day, and you get paid for it! If you google at work to find a solution, it's not a crime, but if you are a surgeon and google stuff while operating people, you'll probably go to jail soon.

Your knowledge is magic. You can create something out of nothing. No matter how simple the code or the app is, someone will use it and be thankful that the product exists. 
At the end of the day, there are people grinding all day long to get the job you currently have. Be grateful, create your opportunities, and enjoy your day! Tomorrow never comes. It's all now.
