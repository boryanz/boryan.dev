As an aspiring software engineer, there will be times when you get overwhelmed by the comments from your senior peers during the code review process. You've wrote the cleanest possible code, and still got 30+ comments on your pull request. Most of the junior developers I've talked about this, say it's hard to cope with such a thing. 

First, I think this is an excellent opportunity to learn new stuff and even learn how to argue with people if the argument is not strong for the comment they are making.

Second, I saw highly experienced seniors who got 70+ comments on their PR's. I want to point out that the code you'll write today is not a representation of your image. You will see your code in a couple of months and laugh your ass off. We learn new things, and our thought process changes. That's why I'm in love with this profession. The worst thing is to let the impostor syndrome get you in those times. Try to extract value from the comments and apply the knowledge next time you're developing new features. Your code means nothing. it's your thought process at the moment. 

Sometimes, you'll be tired and not think clearly, so you're writing shitty code. That's also fine as long as you have PR reviewers which really looks at code, and automated tests in place in order not to make a mess. 
Detach yourself from the code. I got this advice from a good friend of mine when I was starting, and it was the best advice ever. I want to pass this on to whoever reads this blog post.

Cheers.
