Hi! 

My name is Boris Janevski and I'm a self-taught software engineer. My passion for programming sparked when I built a mobile app and shipped it online. With no technical background I dived deep into Android development and eventually build the app. It gained some traction and was downloaded more than 2000 times! Rest is history...
I'm currently working in a company which provides mobile banking solutions to Swiss banks where security, clean code and collaboration are the top priorities. 

Some of relevant skills in the current field: 
- MVVM
- MVC
- Clean architecture
- Android SDK
- Kotlin
- Java
- Jetpack compose
- Kotlin coroutines
- Kotlin flows
- Leadership skills
- UX/UI design

Currently learning:
- Pyhton
- Django
- Django Rest Frameqork

In my free time I'm also dad, acrobatic paragliding pilot, street workout athlete, ultra trail runner...
